Scores:
     Q         PREFAB quality score
               = (# correctly aligned letter pairs) / (# aligned pairs in reference)
               Q is the same as the Balibase SP score and Sauder et al. Developer score.

     TC        Balibase total column score
               = (# correctly aligned columns) / (# aligned columns in reference)

     Modeler   Sauder et al. Modeler score
               = (# correctly aligned letter pairs) / (# aligned pairs in test)

     Cline     Shift score, see Cline et al. for definition.
